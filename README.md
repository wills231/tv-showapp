# TVshow-app
- This project was built using the frontend web framework Vue 3. For initial project setup Vue CLI was used.

## Scripting Languages
- Typescript was used as a scripting language and one of the reasons was for it's ease of use in early detecting issues in the IDE.

## Routing
- Vue-router was used as its mostly used for SPA and interactive webpages within Vue

## API
- I used Axios as it is an easy-to-use and compact API used for the communication of HTTP requests.

## Composition API
- Since the release of Vue 3 the Composition API was made accessible for use. The main benefit of the compostion API is its reuse capability. The searchpage of the TVshow app has included the usage of the Composition API.

## Style Preprocessing
- SCSS syntax was included for style preprocessing as it gives an efficient way of nesting and usage of various functions/mixins/variables etc. I would have liked to have structured my css with atomic design principles and usage of BEM.

## Unit tests
- Due to time constraints I was not able to create any meaningful unittests but would definetely like to have added them.
